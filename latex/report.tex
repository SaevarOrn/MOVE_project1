\begin{homeworkProblem}

    The scheduler is made up of a $n$ cells, where cell $i$ controls $P_i$. A cell contains $4$ ports it uses for comunication. $in$ and $out$ ports are used to comunicate with other cells in the scheduler and $a$ and $b$ are used to signal the proces to start and end execution. Each cell is defined using the following template:
    \[
        P = \overline{in}.a.out.b.P
    \]
    We then connect the cells together using relabelling and the scheduler then simply runs each cell in parallel. We restrict the ports $in$ and $out$ since they must be matched by another cell but we allow $a$ and $b$ to communicate with the environment so we can monitor the actions the sche. Each cell initially waits for a signal before starting and so to prevent a deadlock, we send a single signal to the first cell which starts the scheduler.

    Listing \ref{../task1.ccs} shows the CCS code for a scheduler with four processes.

    \perlscript{../task1.ccs}{Scheduler .CCS file}

    There are two requirements that the scheduler must satisfy. The first requirement is that each process must start in a cyclical order, $P_{i+1}$ starts after $P_{i}$ and $P_1$ starts after $P_n$. The second requirement is that each cell must alternate between $a$ and $b$ actions.

    First we will show that if we ignore the $b$ moves, then the scheduler is bisimilar to a process that simply performs actions $a_1,a_2,\dots,a_n$ repeadedly:
    \[
        cyclic = a_1.a_2.\dots.a_n.cyclic
    \]
    The process can perform $a$ and $b$ moves and so we need to change it such that the $b$ moves cannot be observed. The way we do this is by defining an observer that runs in parallel with the scheduler and recieves the $b$ moves of the cells.
    \[
        B = \sum_{i=1}^n\overline{b_i}.B
    \]
    We then restrict the $b$ moves so only the $a$ moves are visible but the execution of the scheduler is not affected. The definition for this new process is as follows:
    \[
        Y = (S|B)\backslash\{b_i|1\le i\le n\}
    \]
    Using the cwb workbench, we can now easily verify that $cyclic$ and $Y$ are bisimilar.

    For the second requirement, we will verify that a single cell must always alternate between $a$ and $b$. Instead of doing this for each cell in the scheduler, it is enough to show that it holds for the template they are instanciated from. Since we are only interesed in $a$ and $b$ actions, we must hide the $in$ and $out$ actions. Similar as to before, we define a new process, $Z$, that can send and recieve $in$ and $out$ actions.
    \[
        Z = in.\overline{out}.Z \\
    \]
    And then run $Z$ and the template, $P$, in parallel with the $in$ and $out$ actions restricted.
    \[
        W = (Z|P)\backslash\{in,out\}
    \]
    If the scheduler satisfies the property that each cell alternates between $a$ and $b$ actions, then $W$ should be weakly bisimilar to the following process:
    \[
        alternate = \overline{a\vphantom{d}}.\overline{b}.alternate
    \]
    Again we use the cwb workbench to verify that $W$ and $alternate$ are weakly bisimilar.

%	PROBLEM 2
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\begin{homeworkProblem}

  The second task at hand was to implement one-dimensional solitaire and to prove that it is solvable using the CCS concurrency workbench.
  The game was modelled as processes, where each tile is a process \(B(lack), W(hite),\) or \( E(mpty) \) and the board is a set of tiles (concurrent processes). 
  The three different colors were modelled as different processes. The processes were defined as templates and were created with appropriate relabellings to indicate location-based pairing between processes. 
	Solitaire has the helpful property that the $Empty$ tile must be swapped with whatever tile wants to swap, so we modelled the $Empty$ tile as having output ports for each direction and colored tiles to have input ports in their respective directions 
	($Black$ tiles can only go right and $White$ tiles can only go left) for the adjacent tile and its immediate neighbor.
	\emph{(Note: inputs and outputs can be freely interchanged here, since it is only the pairing that matters \-- $Empty$ tiles were selected as the output to improve readability in the source code.)}

	Listing \ref{../task2.ccs} demonstrates this functionality:

\perlscript{../task2.ccs}{1-Dimensional Solitaire .CCS file}
  Each template behaves differently based on what color it represents. Black tiles can jump either one or two tiles to the right depending on whether the $Empty$ tile is one or two tiles to the right (white tiles mirror this functionality in the opposite direction). Recall that $Empty$ tiles can swap with any adjacent tile.
  Relabelling the processes ensured that changing a process (for example, \(B \rightarrow W\)) allowed new input/output pairs to be matched.


  To transition from the configuration \([B_1|B_2|E_3|B_4|W_5|W_6|W_7]\) to \([B_1|B_2|W_3|B_4|E_5|W_6|W_7]\), $W_5$ must switch places with $E_3$ (by jumping over $B_4$).
  This move is made possible by the consistent location-dependent relabelling \-- recall that the board is modelled as concurrent processes.
  The relabelling on $E_3$ was \([b3/b, r4/rone, r5/rtwo, l3/l, r3/r, w3/w, l2/lone, l1/lone]\) when it was created as $B_3$, which means that $E_3$ exists as:
\[
	proc ~ E_3 = ~ \overline{r3}.B_3 + ~ \overline{l3}.W_3
\]
In a similar fashion, $W_5$ exists as:
\[
  proc ~ W_5 = ~ w_5.W_5 + ~ l4.E_5 + ~ l3.E_5
\]
Since these processes are running in parallel and restrictions are in place, $E_3$ is blocked until it is matched on either $'r3'$ or $'l3$. Incidentally, $W_5$ can match with $l3$, allowing the processes to swap 'colors' (the only other possibility would be for $W_5$ to indicate that tile 5 is white with the $w_5$ message).

In a similar fashion, if we had started in the configuration \([B_1|B_2|E_3|W_4|B_5|W_6|W_7]\), $W_4$ would be able to swap places with $E_3$ on $l3$ since $W_4$ would have been:
\[
	proc ~= W_4 = ~ w_4.W_4 + ~ l3.E_4 + ~ l2.E_4
\]

% CORRECTNESS AND VERIFICATION DETAILS BELOW

  Showing possible moves does not prove that the game is solvable (even though we can use these moves to solve it in our heads).
  To verify the correctness of the solitaire game, we simply asked if a configuration representing a solved game was reachable: 
  
\perlscript{../task2.mu}{1-Dimensional Solitaire .MU file}

  This elegant solution works due to the way that the game was modelled.
	Colored tiles (\(B_i, W_i\)) can always indicate what color occupies tile $i$ since $proc ~ Board$ does not restrict on $W_i$ (for any $i$).
	Therefore we can describe the property of a $solved$ game as ``Tiles $1-3$ are white and $5-7$ are black''.
	Using the fixed point-notation of Hennessy–Milner logic, we simply ask if the state is reachable from the start configuration:
	\[
		\$~cwb-nc> ~ chk~Board~is\_solvable
	\]

	\ldots which the concurrency workbench indicates as being $TRUE$.
