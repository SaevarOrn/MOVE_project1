* Templates for `Empty', `Black' and `White' tiles, (modeled as processes)
proc TE = 'r.TB + 'l.TW
proc TB = b.TB + rone.TE + rtwo.TE

* Create three black tiles, named T{1-3} where T becomes B,W or E (color)

* Create a single empty tile, named T4

* Board is the main process representing the game
* We define the board in the initial configuration and restrict on restrict_set
proc Board = (B1|B2|B3|E4|W5|W6|W7)\restrict_set

* restrict_set is the set of labels that are restricted
* a restricted label is a label that cannot be executed
set restrict_set = {l0,l1,l2,l3,l4,l5,l6,l7,r0,r1,r2,r3,r4,r5,r6,r7}
